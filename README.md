# JavaPractice
Here I post my practical problems that I solved from scratch. Also, after some time I will add to this repository projects made on freelance, pet-projects and written in a team or solo applications.
Thanks.

September 2022.
At the moment I am engaged in solving problems on the practical application of their knowledge, in about a week, I will begin to engage in freelance tasks, to raise the commercial and professional experience.
The tasks are from this Russian-language website on computer science and mathematics - http://www.itmathrepetitor.ru/prog/zadachi-na-vychisleniya/
